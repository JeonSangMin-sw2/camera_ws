# Package layout: core/ and ui/ are real packages at the project root
# (imports throughout the codebase are `core.xxx`, `core.calibration.xxx`,
# `ui.xxx`), so no package_dir remapping and no py_modules list is needed.
# The old py_modules entries (marker_detection, robot_motion, paths,
# language, i18n, wizard_widget) referred to modules that no longer exist
# at that location: robot_motion -> core/robot/motion.py, paths -> core/storage.py,
# wizard_widget -> ui/wizard_widget.py, i18n was removed, marker_detection and
# language now live under core/ as core.marker_detection / core.language.
